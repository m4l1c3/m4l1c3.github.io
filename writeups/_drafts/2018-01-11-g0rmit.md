First off, find the box:

{% highlight bash %}
netdiscover -r 192.168.171.0/24

Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

{% endhighlight %}

Scan with nmap:

{% highlight bash %}
nmap -T4 -A -oA g0rmint  192.168.171.138
{% endhighlight %}

Looks like 22 and 80 are open, not a lot to go on...

Accessing the server on port 80 returns a 404 page, better try for a robots.txt and find this:

/* Too easy? Lets see */
Disallow: /g0rmint/*

Now I'm faced with a login page and nothing to go on, however the following showed up in the login page's markup:

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="backup-directory" content="s3cretbackupdirect0ry">
{% endhighlight %}

Next run dirb to try and find hidden content, nothing really popped up.

I tried fuzzing a bunch of mobile user agents to see if this meta tag somehow triggers a different page response as well as brute forcing the login/reset forms, nothing seemed to be working.

Then I remembered I need to try force browsing that directory now that new file system elements exist:

{% highlight bash %}

dirb http://192.168.171,138/g0rmint/s3crebackupdirect9ry

{% endhighlight %}
