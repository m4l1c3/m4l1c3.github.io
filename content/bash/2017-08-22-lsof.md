lsof get a list of running files: man lsof

grep -ir 'root' 2>&1 | grep '123456' 2>&1 | grep -v 'denied'

Useful for times when you are ripping through the entire file system (with or without priviliges) and supress the 'Access denied' messages so inaccessible information is not shown in grep output.
