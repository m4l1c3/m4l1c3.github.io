    <div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Starting by scanning the hosts with nmap:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">nmap -T4 -A -v -p0-65535 192.168.110.105 -oN nmap-results.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>T4 for faster execution</li>
<li>A for OS detection</li>
<li>p0-65535 for scanning ports 0 - 65535</li>
<li>oN nmap-results.txt for writing output to a file using the &quot;normal&quot; format.  Also supports xml, script kiddy, and grepable format</li>
</ul>
<p>The scan returned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wordpress site - 69</li>
<li>Another site - 80</li>
<li>Possible telnet - 23</li>
<li>FTP - 21</li>
<li>SSH - 1974, weird</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="telnet">Telnet</h2>
<p>Trying to connect via telnet I got a message mentioning ROTten passwords, maybe ROT-13 encoded (http://decode.org/) Got back exschmenuating.</p>
<p>##Another &quot;Site&quot;
Checking that as a folder, got lucky and found &quot;Eric's&quot; secret page.</p>
<p>Alternate Route:
Using cewl against the Billy Madison script from here: http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=billy-madison and generating a wordlist:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cewl -w billy-madison-wordlist.list -d 0 -v http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=billy-madison
</code></pre>
<p>Which found: exschmenuating</p>
<p>Then run that through dirbuster and brute force on our new wordlist, this also finds the hidden &quot;site&quot;</p>
<p>Also found a banned hosts file as well showing I'd been banned from connecting via telnet.</p>
<p>In Eric's notes it looks like he may have been sending a phishing e-mail to Veronica and mentioned the file containing everything (probably a network capture) had her name in it.  Since Kali comes with the rockyou wordlist I generated a new word list containing anything that had 'veronica' in it with this command:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">grep -ir 'veronica' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt >> ./veronica.list
</code></pre>
<p>Then ran that through dirbuster with the file extensions: pcap and cap on the subdirectory /exschmenuating which found: 012987veronica.cap.</p>
<p>Time to grab that through the browser or with wget and open up Wireshark.  I was able to follow the TCP stream (under analyze in the menus) to step through the emails and see the communication back and forth between her and Eric.</p>
<p>Looks like the machines &quot;anti-virus&quot; caught the malware, but unfortunately Veronica had Eric upload the file with FTP so she can just run the executable, she gave a weird hint referencing the &quot;Spanish Armada&quot; fortunately I've seen the movie and a youtube video was included.  When the spanish armada is mentioned Billy states the following guesses, seems like port numbers: 1466 67 1469 1514 1981 1986.  After some googling it turns out there is a thing called port knocking, basically if you have a service you want to hide you can require that ports get pinged in a specific order another port that the service is running on will open up, then pinging the ports in reverse order closes the service's port.</p>
<p>With this bash command I was able to ping all the ports in order against the host:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">for x in 1466 67 1469 1514 1981 1986; do nmap -Pn --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x bm; done
</code></pre>
